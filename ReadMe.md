## Web-based Pothole Tracking and Repair System

### The department of public works for a large city has decided to develop a web-based pothole tracking and repair system (PHTRS). A description follows:

1. Citizens can log onto a website and report the location and severity of potholes. As potholes are reported, they are logged within a "public works department repair system" and are assigned an identifying number, stored by street address, size (on a scale of 1 to 10), location (middle, curb, etc.), district (determined from street address), and repair priority (determined from the size of the pothole).

2. Work order data are associated with each pothole and include pothole location and size, repair crew identifying number, number of people on crew, equipment assigned, hours applied to repair, hole status (work in progress, repaired, temporary repair, not repaired), amount of filler material used, and cost of repair (computed from hours applied, number of people, material and equipment used).

3. Finally, a damage file is created to hold information about reported damage due to the pothole and includes the citizen's name, address, phone number, type of damage, and dollar amount of damage. PHTRS is an online system; all queries are to be made interactively.

4. Draw a UML use case diagram for a PHTRS system. You'll have to make a number of assumptions about the manner in which a user interacts with this system. Use Python to write a script that will print out the different actors and use cases  and a brief description of your diagram.

5. Submit the source file (.py), the screenshots of a successful execution of your program, and all related diagrams in a zipped folder.
