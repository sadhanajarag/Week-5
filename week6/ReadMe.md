# Stepwise Refinement Approach
## Apply a “stepwise refinement approach” to develop three different levels of procedural abstractions for one or more of the following programs:

1. Develop a check writer that, given a numeric dollar amount, will print the amount in words normally required on a check.
2. Iteratively solve for the roots of a transcendental equation.
3. Develop a simple task-scheduling algorithm for an operating system.

Write an algorithm in Python that will represent your stepwise refinement approach for the program of your choice.
