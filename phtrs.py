    The PHTRS (Pothole and Highway Traffic Repair System) allows citizens to report potholes and damage claims through an online platform. 
    Citizens can log onto the website and report the location and severity of potholes. As potholes are reported, they are logged 
    within the 'Public Works Department Repair System' and assigned an identifying number. The system stores details such as street address, 
    pothole size (on a scale of 1 to 10), location (middle of the road, curb, etc.), district (determined by the street address), 
    and repair priority (based on the size of the pothole).

    Work order data are associated with each pothole, which includes:
    - Pothole location and size
    - Repair crew identifying number
    - Number of people on the crew
    - Equipment assigned
    - Hours applied to repair
    - Hole status (e.g., work in progress, repaired, temporary repair, not repaired)
    - Amount of filler material used
    - Cost of repair (calculated based on hours, number of people, materials, and equipment used)

    Additionally, a damage file is created to hold information about any damage reported due to the pothole. This file includes:
    - Citizenâ€™s name, address, and phone number
    - Type of damage (e.g., vehicle damage, property damage)
    - Dollar amount of damage reported

    The system ensures that citizens can report issues easily and track repair progress, while also assisting the Public Works Department in managing and prioritizing repair tasks efficiently.
